# Denison Dining App

An App that help students check their today's menu of campus dining halls. 
Built with Flutter and Firebase.

> Simple and Easy to Use to Anyone.

That is our first rule!

## Motivation

> **"What's the menu today?"**

This is the one of the most common questions I heard through my semesters in campus. Then, I found that most of students do not check their menu before visiting dining hall eventhough our university's catering service company offers their own website that displays menu. I have analysed that it was because of tiresome, since it required people to have extra steps to see the menu. Therefore, to make convenience for myself and other, I decided to make an app that is simple but fast-delivering menu to students.

## Getting Started

I have gathers two friends who are feeling same needs, and also having same technological interest. We have decided to make both Android and iOS apps, since most of students use iPhone but there are many international students who uses Android phones.  Therefore, we decided to develop with Flutter. It was great choice to use because it is used to develop cross platform applications from a single code base.
We wanted this app to be not only just menu app, but also an app that delivers variety of campus information. Therefore, we integrated Firebase to enable displaying campus event posters, campus map, google map, and more!

## Usage

User may use this app to compare the menu of different dining halls to decide where to go for today's breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, this app will be good to see today's pop-up menu and on-going events in campus.
